The Indie Web is a movement. One where people who have decided the internet is way too corporate, move to make their own parts of the web in order to have more control over their experience and data online. It is mainly comprised of people who have made their own [[personal websites\|personal websites]], like this one, but can also include things like browsing non-corporate forums and shifting to using [[RSS feeds\|RSS feeds]] instead of a [[social media feed\|social media feed]].

I got into website making in 2024 and I fell in love with it. I'm not an amazing coder, but I am actively trying to get better as time goes on! I really love the self-expression coding allows me over all other forms of social media and I love how other small websites allow me the space to really think more nuancedly about the things I am reading on other small web sites, something that social media does not really allow.

I enjoy a break from the constant need to be outraged that social media provides and on the small web I can just read people opinions and really swallow them, churn them over, come to come kind of understanding, then move on with my day, rather than being bombarded with 1 million opinions on the same topic and not having the time to just sit with it and try to really understand the opinion or even come up with my own. 

I've also really enjoyed the more thought out content on people's websites. Due to the nature of personal websites, most people write very detailed blog posts, much more detailed than a twitter or Instagram post could ever be. Even if I disagree with someone's opinion, being able to understand how someone came to to that conclusion is very enlightening and I have found has helped to change the way I think about others, making me more understanding and tolerant, even more willing to hear opposite opinions. Social media really beats that skill out of you (with how most people's mentality on it is to scream your opinions into each others faces in the hopes the other person jut decides to 100% agree with you), and I am glad to have regained it and escaped that hell-scape.
