## About
I love learning, and I often let my curiosity take me down rabbit holes. 
I started this as a place to expand my knowledge and find links between all the things I have been studying or thinking about to make a map of my knowledge! 

Here you will find:
- Notes on things I have read, watched, or listened to and how they have informed my knowledge on many different topics
- Book/character analyses  
- and more!

> [!Note]
> This is not a blog. This is where I will store my knowledge on the different things I learn and study. This is closer to a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or a [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/The Web/Digital Garden/Digital Garden 🌱\|Digital Garden 🌱]] (kind of a mix between the two) where as I create notes, new connections between notes will form and I can see where each piece of knowledge that I garner are connecting, and where the gaps in my knowledge on certain subjects are!

My current structure for this digital garden is:
- 🌱 **Seeds:** The beginnings of your knowledge. Small thoughts or ideas that you want/need to expand upon and are not currently fleshed out or well-researched, don't have many connections or notes that I feel need a few more sources before I can call them a 'complete' piece of knowledge.
- 🌳 **Trees:** More expanded knowledge that now have a lot of other links to more information, expanding upon the original idea. Think of the branches of a tree, they are connected to the main idea, but have branched into their own network of information.
- 🍎 **Fruits:** Finalized ideas, writings, thoughts or essays that have solidified themselves in the garden and require little to no tending anymore.
- 🥀 **Defunct:** This is one that I personally use, it means that I no longer agree with the content inside the note or have abandoned it for now.

---------------------

One big reason I wanted to make this was that, when you write about the things you learn, you realize just how much you understand a subject. If I struggle to write about something, it means I still don't quite understand the topic, which indicates I need to do more research. And, writing about what you learn helps to solidify that knowledge in your brain as well as giving you a reference (that you have written in your own works, making it easier to understand) to come back to later!

I am starting out small and slow, and I know I have a very surface-level idea of most things at the moment, but I hope to grow my knowledge as I go along! 
As my knowledge grows, my opinions and ideas may change, but I will not delete notes. I will just change the name to include [defunct thought 🥀] or something similar as this happens. That way I can look back and see how far I have come! 

**Please note: This entire garden is not to be taken as fact, or meant for anyone other than myself really to give any credence to. 

**Also please note I do a lot of research on things that I do not personally agree with (e.g political ideologies, concepts from fandom etc to better understand both why I disagree with those things and to better understand why someone else might agree with those things. Understanding both sides to anything is important.) Not every single thing written in this digital garden is in line with my personal beliefs, I just let my research follow my curiosity. You may disagree with some things I have written about, and that's okay. ****

My current interests include:
- Reading (A mix of classic literature and more modern sci-fi and fantasy stories)
- Sewing
- Filmmaking
- Story Writing and Story/Character analysis
- 3D Modelling
- Gardening
- Random little bits of psychology

^ My site will probably start out with a lot of notes on these kinds of things.

#### How did I make this?
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as the writing program for this page. I love it, it's free. 

Also, this page is run using the [Digital Garden plugin ](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/01-getting-started/)for Obsidian using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as the host. If you also want to make one, please note that Vercel does not accept Proton emails at the moment and you will need to use some other provider in order to make an account. 

#### Why post this publicly?
I dunno, fun? I like putting the things I am doing up on the internet for other people to see! There are tons of things across the internet that others post mainly for themselves that I also enjoy looking at, and I wanted to do the same, because maybe there is someone out there who is also interested in some of the topics I am looking into here! 

I also want to inspire others to make their own digital gardens or research projects, because I believe there is a decline in people who want to learn things and with the rise of AI where people just let the AI tell them what to think, I feel learning how to research and think for yourself is more important now than ever.  
Not to mention, this can be a really awesome ideation device! Once you have a bunch of notes, you begin to notice that completely different topics eventually gain a link to one another, for example you have two notes in different topics and realize, "Hang on, I think these two ideas have some kind of correlation" So you make a new note, and BAM! You've got an idea for a piece of art, or an essay, or a zine or anything else you love making.

## Get Started
Still confused on what this page is? Here's some more info:

Check out the folders along the left! 
I have structured things like this: 


***Sources:*** This is where I keep all the sources I have referenced in my Knowledge notes. These will really only contain a quick synopsis or overview of the source and some direct quotes that came from that source.

***Notes:*** This is where write all my notes on each of my *sources* that I read. So in there I will put quotes and how I interoperate them, notes on what I thought on certain things brought up in the sources I read and other things that stood out to me. 

***Knowledge:*** Everything in this folder are structured and thought-out notes that I have written on topics *after* I have done research! These are my more solidified notes where, after I have done a lot of reading on a certain subject, I will write down all the knowledge and idea I gained in my own words, and independent of the source material. 
These are the only notes in the digital garden that will use the notes status emojis (🌱🌳🍎🥀) to show their stage of growth, as these are the ones that hold my actual knowledge, while the others do not. 
These notes will be as concise as possible (trying to keep them to around 200 words as much as possible).

***Musings:*** This is where I write thoughts about topics and maybe even questions to myself to look into later

Having so many folders for different topics can seem like it is defeating the purpose of the digital garden, and this may change later on where I remove all the folders. But for now they are there so that if I ever want to refer to a specific subject, I can find it in that folder and use is as a jumping off point to look through my notes. The graph view and the links within each note are really the point of this whole thing though.

This is how I structure it! So first I will read my source, take notes on it then I will move to solidify what I learned by writing in my own words about a topic that the source brought up. For example, if I did a film study and I noticed that the framing in a certain scene changed the tone of the film, I will take notes on that source, find more sources that tell me about how framing is used in films, then I will link all those sources to a new note that I will call something like "Framing can have an affect on the tone of a film" and write about what I learned from all those sources together. 
I could even then make another note that is higher than that called 'How to create emotion in a film' where I can link the previous note to. 

If you look at the graph on the right, you can see that slowly, as I learn things, I can link more and more things together and it forms a web of knowledge! 
That's the basics of how this all works.
