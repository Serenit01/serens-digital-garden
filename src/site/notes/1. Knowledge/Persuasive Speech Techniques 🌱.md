There are many techniques you can use to make a persuasive speech, or any kind of text for that matter.

1. Appeal to Authority. Important people or experts can make your argument seem more convincing and using reliable research could help your argument seem convincing. (maybe this last part is less important in this new 'information age' where you can say anything and people will believe it without thinking, since no one really does their own research these days beyond a 1 min google search.)
2. Appeal to Reason. - Facts, Figures
3. Appeal to Emotion 
4. Appeal to Trust - "I'm just like you, I have been there too"
5. Plain Folks - "I'm not that special, I'm just like you"
6. Bandwagon - IF everyone believes it or does it, that must mean it's true.
7. Rhetorical Questions
8. Repetition and [[motif \|motif ]]
