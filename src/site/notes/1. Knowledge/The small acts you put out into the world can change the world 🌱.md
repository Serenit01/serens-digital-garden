Every little thing you say or do has the possibility to change the world around you in some small way. Giving up is not an option. There are so many humans on this planet, and if each day, each one did a single small thing to make the world a better place, the world would not seem as dark as it is. **The future is not inevitable, you, together with everyone else, have power and you have [[self-efficacy\|self-efficacy]].**

**Every day you should wake up and think about how you can make the world a little better today. Whether it's taking care of yourself by eating healthy so you have more energy the next day, or whether it's picking up a fallen branch and moving it so someone won't trip. You small actions can have big effects later down the line.**

Of course, there are some things we cannot change alone. But sitting around and waiting for the world to go to shit just because you feel it coming won't make your world or anyone else's world any better. 

[[struthless\|struthless]] suggests that, in a way to [[back yourself\|back yourself]], you should think of the [[Butterfly Effect\|Butterfly Effect]] more often in your life, and think about how small phrases you can say to yourself or put out into the world can make big changes in the world. Since, everything starts out as small, and from little things, big things can grow. 

Plant the seeds today, so you can see them grow around you over the years to come. 

Begin by asking yourself "What small deed can I do today that can affect the world around me?"

Ideas:
- Watering your plants so the grow healthy and continue to look nice and product oxygen
- Writing a blog post about something important to your community or to inspire others (online communities count as well)
- Saying hello to a stranger and wishing them a good day
- Donating things you no longer need to someone else
- Making a tutorial on how to do something you are very good at and share it with others
- Offer help to someone
- Take your dog for a walk
- Put up a bird house
- Plant some seeds of plants that your local insects enjoy
- Plant a tree
- Compliment someone

> [!QUOTE]
> "When people talk about traveling to the past, they worry about radically changing the present by doing something small. But barely anyone in the present things that they can radically change the future by doing something small." #quote - Tumblr User 'Just-Shower-Thoughts'.



> [!QUOTE] Title
> “He shook his head pityingly. “This, more than anything else, is what I have never understood about your people. You can roll dice, and understand that the whole game may hinge on one turn of a die. You deal out cards, and say that all a man's fortune for the night may turn upon one hand. But a man's whole life, you sniff at, and say, what, this naught of a human, this fisherman, this carpenter, this thief, this cook, why, what can they do in the great wide world? And so you putter and sputter your lives away, like candles burning in a draft.”

> “Not all men are destined for greatness,” I reminded him.

> “Are you sure, Fitz? Are you sure? What good is a life lived as if it made no difference at all to the great life of the world? A sadder thing I cannot imagine. Why should not a mother say to herself, if I raise this child aright, if I love and care for her, she shall live a life that brings joy to those about her, and thus I have changed the world? Why should not the farmer that plants a seed say to his neighbor, this seed I plant today will feed someone, and that is how I change the world today?” 
> 
> “This is philosophy, Fool. I have never had time to study such things.” 
> 
> “No, Fitz, this is life. And no one has time not to think of such things. Each creature in the world should consider this thing, every moment of the heart's beating. Otherwise, what is the point of arising each day?” - **Royal Assassin, by Robin Hobb** #quote
