People who make a [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Tulpas and Tulpamancy/Tulpa ðŸŒ±\|Tulpa ðŸŒ±]], with enough time and effort can get to the point where they can do something called 'Switching'. 
This is where the host and the Tulpa can switch placed with each other, allowing the Tulpa to control the body for a short time. 

There are many different forms this can take though, with different levels of control for each party.
