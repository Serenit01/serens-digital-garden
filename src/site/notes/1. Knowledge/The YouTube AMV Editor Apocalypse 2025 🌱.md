There have been many purges of fan editors' channels on YouTube over the years, where one day, editors will wake up and find their YouTube channel has just been obliterated. 

Beginning in August 2025, a new purge began. Many AMV editors awoke to find an email in their Gmail inbox saying that YouTube had deleted their channel due to "serious or repeated violations of our policies against spam, deceptive practices, and fraud.". This is despite the fact that most editors post less than once a month, if that. 

This began to ramp up around the 8th and 9th of August where more and more people were getting this email. 

A panic began to rise in the editing community, many studios and groups quickly downloading all their videos and backing them up in case they were next.

Some people had had their channels for more than 15 years, and all their videos, their art, was lost. 

Many editors began to speculate to the reason as to why this was happening yet again to the editing community. Some blamed YouTube implementing new AI rules, or speculated that maybe YouTube was experimenting with some new AI channel monitoring program that was incorrectly flagging everyone's channels. 

It's still too soon to tell, as we wait for the appeals to get reviewed by YouTube.
