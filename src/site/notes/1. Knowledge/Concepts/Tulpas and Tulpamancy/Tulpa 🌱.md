A Tulpa is a being that is created within one's head. It could be considered an '[[imaginary friend\|imaginary friend]]'. But is much more than that. 

It is sentient and has it's own opinions, thoughts and personality separate from the 'host' and can communicate with it's host. If it becomes developed enough, it can even share control of the body with the host, known as [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Tulpas and Tulpamancy/Possession or Switching ðŸŒ±\|Possession or Switching ðŸŒ±]].
Hosts say they feel as real as any person. 



- Hosts can have more than one active Tulpa at a time. 

- The term originally comes from Tibetan Buddhism. 

- Creating a tulpa makes you a [[Tulpamancer\|Tulpamancer]].
