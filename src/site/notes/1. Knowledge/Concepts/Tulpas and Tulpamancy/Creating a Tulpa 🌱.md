There are many guides on the r/Tulpa subreddit about how to make a Tulpa. Many of which all commonly say that in order to make a Tulpa you need:

- An idea of what you want it's personality to be like
- An idea of what you want it to look like, how it moves or speaks etc
- A lot of free time to 'meditate' and imagine this Tulpa you are about to create

Often, people will create one based on their favourite characters from a piece of media, as it is easier to visualize the face of an already existing character than to make one from scratch.

After you have decided a form you are supposed to sit and 'meditate' on your Tulpa, or something that is called '[[Tulpaforcing\|Tulpaforcing]]' where you sit and imagine your Tulpa for as long as you can each day until they come to fruition. Some say you should focus on one part of the body at a time until you have a full idea of them in your head, looking at their face, their head, their hands etc. 

As your Tulpa begins to take on a form of it's own and become something more and begins to act independently of you, it is said that it will then begin to decide for itself if it likes it's own appearance and personality and will make changes accordingly.
