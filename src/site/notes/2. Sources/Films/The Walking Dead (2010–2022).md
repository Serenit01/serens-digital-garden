The Walking Dead is a TV show set during the zombie apocalypse and follows Nick Grimes, a cop who wakes up in a hospital after being shot shortly before the zombie uprising began and sets off to find his wife and son. 

### First watch-through
Here are my notes from my first ever watch of this show. I will then look back at these notes after I have finished it to better organise my thoughts and opinions on it, then begin making an analysis of the characters, themes and writing (and maybe other filmmaking techniques) afterwards. I may even to a 2nd re-watch if I feel it is worth my time to do so. 
##### Live Thoughts:
###### Season 2:

- I don't like what they did with Shane's final episodes. It felt way too rushed. I know the build up was slow for a long time but then was rushed to a tipping point for the season finale a little quickly for my liking. There was so much more they could have done with his character before killing him off. I also don't like how they killed Shane. I think there should have been a scene where Shane did something more controlling over the entire group than just trying to kill Rick- like what he had been saying and hinting at for a long time about locking everyone up in the house to take control of the group. 
- I also think Dale's death was cheap, shit and more annoying than emotional. He was one of my favourite characters but his death didn't make me sad because of how stupid it was, it just annoyed me. They had already done the 'All hope is lost' thing when they killed Sophia off a few episodes ago, they didn't need to beat the same dead horse in a meaningless way by killing off the guy who had a conscious. If anything they should have kept Dale to keep the interesting moral conflict within the group. He was such a useful character for storytelling.
- I think the entire horde situation at the end was a bit silly and had little to no build up. The only purpose was to trim the group of useless characters and give them a reason to leave, despite all the things they could have done differently to have handled the horde (like driving the cars away by honking their horns and then losing them and looping back to the farm, or hiding in the basement of the house like Hershel had actually prepared for earlier. Nope, just abandon the entire property that had lots of food and resources and don't even pack anything into the cars despite having plenty of time and people to do something-) I feel it could have been done better or just with more built up at least. I think Hershel gave up his farm way too easily for a man who was adamant he would die on his property before abandoning it 2 mins before bailing and his character backflipped too fast for my liking. Some of the writing in the two finale episodes felt a bit rushed and it felt like they should have been given an extra episode or two to correctly build up the tension.
- I did like the re-grouping scene where they all met up on the highway again.
- I am also unsure about whether I like where Nick's character is going after that last episode. I do understand that he did just kill someone he held dear, but at the same time he is now spouting the same shit Shane was going on about and looks like he may become Shane 2.0.
- I do like that Rick finally stood up for himself though, everyone in that group takes him for granted and is so quick to turn on him over such small things that he would never hold against them were the roles reversed.
- I like what they did with Daryl. He spent so long looking for Sophia, holding out hope and then it was taken from him and he decided to shut himself off from feeling those emotions again for a little while, before beginning to open up again after realizing that people in the group still need him, and wanting to be a good man despite himself. I think I like Daryl best after this season. I hope it stays that way T-T 

###### Season 3:
Ep 1 and 2
- We're really starting this season off with a giant time skip huh? I don't like it tbh, but whatever
- I don't really like whatever this stupid character arc Rick is going through, if he was just going to turn out exactly like Shane, why did they even bother killing Shane? Now there's very little interesting conflict, just a broody guy who's treating his wife like shit and lowkey being a manipulative asshole, letting his wife try to fawn over him to even try and get him to talk to her a tiny bit. I get this is supposed to be a point where Rick's character changes, but something about it just feels so off to me in terms of writing? I need to mull over this some more because I can't quite put my finger on it right now.
- I really don't like 'horror' media where most of the main characters are idiots, and it feels like as the show goes on and the writers try to find more increasingly stupid ways to make it more dramatic, the characters will proceed to loose all their intelligence. Why are we letting the old doctor try and clear out a bunch of zombies when we need him to help deliver a child in a few days (despite the fact they didn't need him to go out and kill zombies earlier in the episode in almost the exact same situation)? Because we want some drama!!! It would be fine if they had had an actual reason or need to send him out, but they really didn't. They even stated as much in the actual episode lmao. It's so senseless.  
- Despite all my complaints an I am still enjoying it overall. I just think there are a ton of stupid writing decisions being made, and after being spoiled with great writing with Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul I think I am very picky now. I am hoping the writing gets better.
