## Quotes
#quote 
	"All I wanted was to sing to God. He gave me that longing... and then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to praise him with music, why implant the desire? Like a lust in my body! And then deny me the talent?"

#quote 
	"From now on, we are enemies - You and I. Because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty, infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation. Because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You, I swear it. I will hinder and harm Your creature as far as I am able. I will ruin Your incarnation."

### First Watch-Through

I watched this film one night at my Grandparents house on Grandad's recommendation after watching Phantom of the Opera the night before with him. 

I loved this film. This is the exact kind of thing that first springs to mind when I think of filmmaking. It is technically amazing and the story is so fucking good. 

I need to watch it a 2nd time to really analyse it and think through my thoughts, but this was a really good film and I am so glad Grandad suggested it. I love stories like this, that show these kinds of sides to humanity.
