Ikigai means 'reason for being' or your reason to live, it is the intersection of multiple aspects of your life. 
- What you love, 
- what the world needs, 
- what you can be paid for 
- and what you are good at

In order to find your Ikigai, you need to do a lot of self reflection and introspection find what is important to you.
