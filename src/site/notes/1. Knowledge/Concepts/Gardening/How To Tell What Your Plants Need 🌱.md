If your plant is wilting, that could mean it is dehydrated, so give it some water!

If your plant has browning tips, it could be suffering from a lack of humidity, underwatering or overwatering. Check which it could be.  

If your plant is dropping leaves the plant may be shocked. This is normal if you have just transplanted it or moved it. It just needs time to adjust.

If your plant has yellowing leaves and browning spots it is probably getting too much sun. 

If the leaves of your plant has leaves that are yellowing at the bottom or on new growth, it might need some fertiliser or trimming back. 

If you plant has leggy growth (Stretched and long) it means it's trying to get more light or is overcrowded.
