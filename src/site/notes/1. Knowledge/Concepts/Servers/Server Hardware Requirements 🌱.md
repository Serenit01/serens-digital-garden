[[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Servers/What is a Server ðŸŒ±\|What is a Server ðŸŒ±]]

Servers require slightly different hardware from a normal computer. 

One such difference is the [[CPU (processor)\|CPU (processor)]]. You can get CPUs that are specifically made for use in servers, which are designed to take less power to run, can handle more tasks simultaneously and can work in tandem with other CPUs on the same motherboard. Desktop CPUs cannot handle as many tasks at the same time and can only work alone. 

These CPUs also support [[ECC RAM\|ECC RAM]] which is a type of RAM that can find and correct memory errors, which can protect your server from going down. These CPUs can handle larger amount of RAM than a desktop computer, have more cores and a larger cache memory. 

Also within a server, you should have your hard drives in a [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Servers/RAID configuration ðŸŒ±\|RAID configuration ðŸŒ±]] to ensure that no data loss happens within your server.

It's also a good idea to have a redundant power supply in case of a power supply failure.
