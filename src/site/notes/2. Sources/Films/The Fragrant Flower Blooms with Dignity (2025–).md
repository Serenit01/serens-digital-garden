The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity is a cute little romance anime about two students from different schools. The problem is that both of these schools hate each others guts.

-----
**Currently up to ep 6**

First thoughts and opinions:
I am still watching it while it is airing, and currently the reason why each of the schools hate each other so much has still not been revealed, and I am beginning to wonder if it ever will be revealed. I feel there needs to be some kind of deeper reason than they hate each other than 'just because'. Or that one school is full of rich people and the other seemingly is full of people who are struggling with the schooling system. There isn't much yet to go off other than the students treating each other badly, and, yes this could just be a school culture thing, where the reasons why have been long forgotten, but some more info or backstory on that would be nice! Because at the moment it feels very surface level.


Things I am enjoying so far:
- The main characters mother is so good, I really like that she's kicking him to fix things and instantly notices when he's feeling down! 
  
- I like anime like this where they don't draw out all the drama for 10+ episodes before they finally address it! (looking at you *Kimi Ni Todoke*, even as I kid I found you painful to sit through)
  
- The main character is smart and pretty emotionally intelligent. He sees a problem, and after working through his emotions, he fixes the problem. He doesn't fall into self pity or ignore the problems, he just does what he can. I really like that, I think he's a really well written character too! 
- **I like that a character who has been hating himself his entire life is slowly beginning to realize that maybe he's not such a monster after all, and just because others treat him so badly, doesn't mean he isn't worthy of love.** It's a really lovely kind of character growth. Watching his negative [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Psychology/Core Beliefs ðŸŒ±\|Core Beliefs ðŸŒ±]]change so much is so lovely, it's nice to watch him begin to treat himself more nicely!
  
- I really like the tropes in this show, to a point. I feel like the main girl (blanking on her name right now) is a little too perfect though, and it's like every single time she's in shot they are portraying her as some kind of saviour or angel, which, she is to some of the characters in the show, and is obviously why they do it so much, but I feel like it's a little over the top in some places. Others, it works perfectly! I just feel like now that we are half way through the show, she needs to start showing some kind of flaw...
