### First watch-through
##### Live Thoughts:
###### Season 2:

- I don't like what they did with Shane's final episodes. It felt way too rushed. I know the build up was slow for a long time but then was rushed to a tipping point for the season finale a little quickly for my liking. There was so much more they could have done with his character before killing him off. I also don't like how they killed Shane. I think there should have been a scene where Shane did something more controlling over the entire group than just trying to kill Rick- like what he had been saying and hinting at for a long time about locking everyone up in the house to take control of the group. 
- I also think Dale's death was cheap, shit and more annoying than emotional. He was one of my favourite characters but his death didn't make me sad because of how stupid it was, it just annoyed me. They had already done the 'All hope is lost' thing when they killed Sophia off a few episodes ago, they didn't need to beat the same dead horse in a meaningless way by killing off the guy who had a conscious. If anything they should have kept Dale to keep the interesting moral conflict within the group. He was such a useful character for storytelling.
- I think the entire horde situation at the end was a bit silly and had little to no build up. The only purpose was to trim the group of useless characters and give them a reason to leave, despite all the things they could have done differently to have handled the horde (like driving the cars away by honking their horns and then losing them and looping back to the farm, or hiding in the basement of the house like Hershel had actually prepared for earlier. Nope, just abandon the entire property-) I feel it could have been done better or just with more build up at least. I think Hershel gave up his farm way too easily and his character backflipped too fast for my liking. Some of the writing in the two finale episodes felt a bit rushed and it felt like they should have been given an extra episode or two to correctly build up the tension.
- I did like the re-grouping scene where they all met up on the highway again.
- I am also unsure about whether I like where Nick's character is going after that last episode. I do understand that he did just kill someone he held dear, but at the same time he is now spouting the same shit Shane was going on about and looks like he may become Shane 2.0.
- I do like that Rick finally stood up for himself though, everyone in that group takes him for granted and is so quick to turn on him over such small things that he would never hold against them were the roles reversed.
- I like what they did with Daryl. He spent so long looking for Sophia, holding out hope and then it was taken from him and he decided to shut himself off from feeling those emotions again for a little while, before beginning to open up again after realizing that people in the group still need him, and wanting to be a good man despite himself. I think I like Daryl best after this season. I hope it stays that way T-T
