The purpose of this research paper is to 'clarify' the existence of associations between the high frequency of disorders among tulpamancers and the reports of improvements in relation to those disorders from practicing tulpamancy. 



- Tulpas are entities that are similar to imaginary friends, but are perceived as real. They can been seen and heard.

- They can grow to have their own thoughts, personality and opinions separate from the host. 

- They are experienced through a mix of auditory, visual, and somatic visualizations and hallucinations.

- it is not the same as DID, as there is no amnesia, depersonalisation or other traumatic symptoms and when 'switching'

- Most tulpamancers have very little opportunity or place to socialize, which could have led them down the route of tulpamancy. 

- Research found that one of the most common reasons for making a tulpa was to have a companion and someone to talk to 

- "In the community, tulpa creation is seen as a way to build a relationship with someone that can understand, accept, and bond with you on a level beyond what is usually possible with another person."

- There was a association found between those with a clinical diagnoses and those who are part of the tulpa community. Namely: 25% were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, 21% were diagnosed with ADD and 18% have GAD (Generalised anxiety disorder)

- Research suggests that tulpas were reported to cause improvements in mental disroders with at least 94% of respondants saying that creating a tulpa had helped them.

- **"In his sample, over half of the tulpamancers on the autism spectrum reported that their tulpas enhance their ability to read and understand others."**

- Tuplas often help their hosts with their issues, as reported by the participants in the survey. When their host is struggling the tulpa helps them. "Tulpas not only provided a means to have pleasant, worry-free interactions in the safety of their own mind-for these hosts, tulpas also encouraged and assisted with socialization." "Hosts consistently describe how their tulpas keep their best interests in mind and take steps to alleviate any ailments, mental or physical, that the host may have in their life. If a disorder is causing distress Research in Psychology and Behavioral Sciences 42 and one’s tulpa happens to be independent from it (as they are, to some degree, in 85% of cases), then we would expect to see what we already observe: tulpas helping their host cope with mental illness"

- 31% of respondents described their relationship with their tulpa as romantic. 78% described it as a friendship.

- One respondant who was diagnosed with Schizophrenia stated that his tulpa can knows the difference between hallucinations and reality and the tulpa helps him with that by developing a way together where they can 'zap' away the delusions. 
- "Others discuss how their tulpas prevented their suicide, be it through words or acting to remove the host’s control of the body."
