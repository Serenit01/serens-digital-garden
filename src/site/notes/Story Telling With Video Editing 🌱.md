When you edit, you are taking every single clip out of it's original context and giving it new context. 
That context, is defined by the clips before and after it.

Cutting to one clip over another can change the entire context of the whole edit. Cutting to a reaction shot vs a cut away gives two completely different feelings to the final edit.
