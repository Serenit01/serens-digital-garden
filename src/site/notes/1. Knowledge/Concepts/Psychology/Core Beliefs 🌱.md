Your 'Core Beliefs' are the things you believe about yourself, others or the world around you that affect how to perceive your reality. They are deeply ingrained into you and are difficult (but not impossible) to change. They are rigid and often not flexible. 

Usually these beliefs have been given lots of proof throughout your life and solidified them.
For example, if you perceived people as abandoning you often, you would gain the core belief that everyone will abandon you eventually. 

Positive examples:
- "I am worthy of love"
- "I am trustworthy"
- "My needs are important"
- "My opinions matter"
- "The whole has many nice people in it"

Negative examples:
- "the world is scary and going to shit"
- "My relationships never work out"
- "I am weak"
- "Everyone will leave me in the end"
