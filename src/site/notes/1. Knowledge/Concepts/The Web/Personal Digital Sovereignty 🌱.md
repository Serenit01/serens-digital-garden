Personal digital sovereignty, while rare at the moment, is all about being in control of your technology and online presence to higher degree than offered by tech companies today. 

This usually involves [[self-hosting\|self-hosting]], making your own [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/Servers/Home Server ðŸŒ³\|Home Server ðŸŒ³]], [[using free and open-source programs\|using free and open-source programs]] and can also entail using [[Linux\|Linux]] to have more control over your machine, making it as catered to you as you need it to be, and keeping the data-hungry corporations out of your life as much as possible! 

It means shutting out big tech by blocking trackers that use and sell all your personal data, keeping your privacy by not letting these companies read all the messages you send to people, and all around just being more in control of how you access the internet. 

A good way to get away from big tech like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok is to join [[The Small Web\|The Small Web]], [[1. Knowledge/The Indie Web\|The Indie Web]], or [[1. Knowledge/Concepts/The Web/The Sovereign Web ðŸŒ±\|The Sovereign Web ðŸŒ±]] (All of these are offshoots of a similar sentiment- getting away from big-tech). You can create your own self-hosted website where you have total control over what goes on it and you never have to cater to an algorithm or the whims of the big tech CEOs.  

Another big part of this movement is that by becoming a part of it you gain better [[Digital Literacy\|Digital Literacy]], which is invaluable in this day and age.
